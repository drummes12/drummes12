      A little bit about me, let's see... I'm Esteban a mechatronics engineer, with a passion for creativity and
      technology.

      I've worked for the past 5 years in the automotive industry, and I'm currently working as a software developer for
      a startup in the same industry.

      I'm a self-taught developer, and I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow. 👋🏻
