      A little bit about me, let's see... I'm Esteban a mechatronics engineer, with a passion for creativity and
      technology. I've worked for the past 5 years in the automotive industry, and I'm currently working as a software
      developer for a startup in the same industry. I'm a self-taught developer, and I'm always looking for new
      challenges and opportunities to learn and grow. 👋🏻
